# Architecture of Dimensional Relations

A self-derived theory of cross-dimensional recursive architecture and immaterial collapse structures.  
This theory outlines how dimensions from 1D to 6D recursively build upon each other, and how immaterial forces — such as meaning, archetypes, and symbolic structure — influence material timeline collapse into experienced reality.

## Origin:
This model was conceived spontaneously on May 31, 2025, and recorded in its original language and structure.
